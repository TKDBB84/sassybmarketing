                                <p>Great to work with Stacey & Jeffrey. They are knowledgeable, friendly, and takes
                                    pride in being thorough with their work. When there were issues from Facebook's
                                    backend, they kept me informed when things would be fixed and kept the process
                                    moving along. I feel confident our ads will be a success and that they are set up
                                    well. Stacey & Jeffrey gave us a good foundation to work from with ads to grow our

                                    customers to survive, but under their guidance things changed. They made changes to
                                    our website, setup a system that allowed us to contact our interested customers
                                    right away, and made our name the top in search results. Last year was our best year
                                    ever, and we are expanding our business. We cannot recommend SavvyB Marketing

                    In Short: We do not knowingly collect data from or market to children under 18 years of age.
                    We do not knowingly solicit data from or market to children under 18 years of age. By using the
                    Services or Apps, you represent that you are at least 18 or that you are the parent or guardian of
                    such a minor and consent to such minor dependent’s use of the Services or Apps. If we learn that
                    personal information from users less than 18 years of age has been collected, we will deactivate the
                    account and take reasonable measures to promptly delete such data from our records. If you become
                    aware of any data we have collected from children under age 18, please contact us at
                    admin@savvybmarketing.com.

                    In Short: You may review, change, or terminate your account at any time.

                    authority. You can find their contact details here:

                </p><br/>
                <p>
                    Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track
                    (“DNT”) feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about
                    your online browsing activities monitored and collected. No uniform technology standard for
                    recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to
                    DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be
                    tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we
                    will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy policy.
